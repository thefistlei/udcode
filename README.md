# UD Code
UD Code, powered by ollama LLM, performs automated source code analysis. It recursively traverses a given directory, reads each source code file, and queries the LLM with the code for interpretation. The generated documentation is saved as Markdown files mirroring the original file.

## Installation
On windows, run generate_sln.bat.
